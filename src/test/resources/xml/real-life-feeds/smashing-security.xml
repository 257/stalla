With hundreds of apps being used in the typical workplace, and the average user having to remember about 40 different passwords, we all know that if we don't have a product to remember passwords they end up in spreadsheets, stored in emails, or left on post-it notes.  And that is a security nightmare. OneLogin allows IT to say which users have access to which applications at what time and also enforce two factor authentication.  So even if credentials are compromised, hackers can’t get access to those corporate services. And, by connecting to Active Directory, access to all of these services is de-provisioned as soon as someone leaves the organisation.
